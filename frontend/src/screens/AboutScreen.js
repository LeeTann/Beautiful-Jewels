        Beautiful Jewels opened in 1980 and built by offering great prices on
        fine vintage jewelry, mint-condition pre-owned watches, loose diamonds,
        and engagement rings, because that was what my customers wanted. As time
        went on, I added select NEW designer jewelry lines because my customers
        asked for them. Vintage and antique jewelry has always been a great
        value for our customers, and the selection is incredible, including
        diamond jewelry, platinum and gold jewelry, precious gemstones, colored
        diamonds, and pearls. There is something for everyone and in every price
        range. With new pieces arriving every day, you will find something
        unique and precious every time you visit us. Like-new, pre-owned
        wristwatches continue to be in strong demand, including such renowned
        brands as Rolex, Cartier, Omega, IWC, TAG Heuer, and more. Fine Swiss
        and German watches are built to last a lifetime so a reconditioned watch
        not only looks and operates as good as new, it's a great value. Only you
        will know you didn't pay full price! Even in these interesting times, we
        want to celebrate the significant events in our lives with style; a
        spectacular engagement ring or diamond anniversary band makes the moment
        extraordinary. Our selection of new diamond jewelry has never been
        better and we carry a vast array of engagement rings and diamond bands.
        We also have a full-service, in-house custom shop to help you create
        your own unique jewelry design or custom wedding bands. Offering
        exceptional values on fine vintage jewelry, pre-owned watches, and new
        engagement and wedding rings, coupled with our strong relationships with
        brands such as Hearts On Fire®, Memoire®, Madison L, Beverly K, Venetti,
        Hamilton, Wolf Designs, Denny Wong, and Tissot, will allow us to better
        serve you in the value-driven future.

        We take trade-ins of jewelry, gold, and watches, so bring in whatever
        you don't want and trade it for what you do want! Trade your diamond for
        a bigger one, perhaps even an incredible Hearts On Fire diamond! We have
        also opened estate buying offices throughout San Diego County, so that
        you don't have to drive as far to get cash for your valuables. We are
        San Diego's largest buyer of pre-owned jewelry, scrap gold, coins,
        sterling silverware, diamonds, and fine watches and we pay the highest
        possible prices. Transactions are private, secure, and easy; we are your
        trusted jeweler when it comes time to cash in that jewelry or watch that
        you never wear. Your ongoing support has meant the world to us and we
        want to give back to you through excellent service and great values.
        Thank you for being a part of our family, and welcome aboard if you have
        just joined us on the trip into a bright future with Beautiful Jewels.
